# N-Dimensional Chess: Beyond the Standard Board

Welcome to N-Dimensional Chess, an advanced chess simulation that extends the traditional game into higher dimensions! This guide will help you understand how to navigate and play this mathematically-enriched chess experience.

## Authors
This project was created as a collaborative effort by:

Timothy Winans and Owen McMann

We developed the concepts, mathematical framework, and the interactive game as part of the Univerity of Maryland Baltimore County HONR 300 â€“ Mathematics of the Universe course in Spring 2025.

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Game**: Open the application in your web browser by navigating to the URL or running the application locally.
2. **Basic Controls**:
   - Use the **mouse** to rotate the view by clicking and dragging
   - Use the **scroll wheel** to zoom in and out
   - Click on chess pieces to select them
   - Click on valid highlighted tiles to move

## Game Interface

The interface includes several panels to help you navigate the n-dimensional space:

- **Game Status Panel**: Shows the current turn and complexity score
- **Dimensional Controls**: Toggle dimensions on/off and adjust visualization
- **Mathematical Insights**: Displays formulas and explanations about the current dimensional space
- **Captured Pieces**: Shows pieces captured by each player

## Understanding Dimensions

The game starts in 3D mode (three dimensions), but you can expand it to higher dimensions:

- **Dimension 1 (D1)**: X-axis (horizontal)
- **Dimension 2 (D2)**: Z-axis (depth)
- **Dimension 3 (D3)**: Y-axis (vertical)
- **Dimension 4-6 (D4-D6)**: Higher dimensions, invisible but mathematically accessible

Use the dimension toggle buttons to add or remove dimensions from the game. The color-coded dimension axes help visualize directions.

## Chess Pieces

### Standard Pieces
All traditional chess pieces are available with their standard movement patterns in 2D:
- **Pawn**: Moves forward one square, captures diagonally
- **Rook**: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares
- **Knight**: Moves in an L-shape (2 squares in one direction, then 1 square perpendicular)
- **Bishop**: Moves diagonally any number of squares
- **Queen**: Combines rook and bishop movements
- **King**: Moves one square in any direction

### Hyperpieces
When you enable dimensions beyond the 3rd, special hyperpieces become available:

- **Hyperrook**: Can move along any dimension, one dimension at a time
- **Hyperbishop**: Moves along diagonal paths in higher dimensions
- **Hyperknight**: Makes L-shaped jumps that can pass through higher dimensions

Hyperpieces are visually distinguished by their glowing auras and pulsing animations.

## Special Mechanics

### Dimensional Transport
Pieces can move through higher dimensions to reach positions that appear disconnected in lower dimensions. This creates powerful shortcuts through space.

### Dimensional Fatigue
Using multiple higher dimensions simultaneously reduces a piece's range. The formula for dimensional fatigue is:

```
Range = Base Range / (2^(dimensions_used-1))
```

This mechanic balances the power of higher-dimensional movement.

### Mathematical Complexity Score
Each move receives a complexity score based on:
- The piece type (hyperpieces score higher)
- Number of dimensions used
- Distance traveled
- Whether a capture occurred

Higher complexity scores indicate more mathematically sophisticated moves. Watch for special notifications when you make particularly complex moves!

## View Controls

Use the view controls to change how you visualize the n-dimensional space:
- **3D View**: Shows three dimensions simultaneously
- **2D View**: Shows only two dimensions at once
- **Slice View**: Shows a specific slice of higher dimensions

You can also select which dimensions to map to the X, Y, and Z axes in the physical view.

## Mathematical Insights

The mathematical insights panel provides formulas and explanations about:
- The properties of the current dimensional space
- The movement patterns of hyperpieces
- The mathematical concepts behind dimensional transport

Pay attention to the mathematical notifications that appear during gameplay to learn more about the theory behind n-dimensional spaces.

## Tips for New Players

1. **Start simple**: Begin by playing in 3D mode to get familiar with the basic controls
2. **Experiment with dimensions**: Gradually add higher dimensions to explore new movement possibilities
3. **Watch the axes**: The colored arrows indicate the orientation of each dimension
4. **Use hyperpieces wisely**: Their ability to move through higher dimensions makes them powerful but complex
5. **Plan your dimensional moves**: Higher-dimensional moves can create surprising tactical opportunities

## Advanced Strategies

- Use dimensional transport to escape checkmate by moving through a higher dimension
- Set up multi-dimensional forks where threats exist in different dimensional planes
- Create fortress positions that are defended from multiple dimensions
- Achieve higher complexity scores by making mathematically sophisticated moves

Enjoy exploring the mathematical beauty of n-dimensional chess!
