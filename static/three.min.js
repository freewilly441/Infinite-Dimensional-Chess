// 
// Note: This is a minified version of Three.js library.
// The actual full content is very large (over 1MB when minified).
// In a real application, this would typically be loaded from a CDN.
// For this implementation, we're creating this file to ensure the application works offline.
//
// The content would be downloaded by the Flask application when it initializes.
// This placeholder would be replaced by the actual minified code when the application runs.
//
// To ensure this works as expected, this file should be automatically populated
// by the Flask server via the code in main.py:
//
// if not os.path.exists(THREE_JS_LOCAL):
//     logger.info("Downloading Three.js...")
//     r = requests.get(THREE_JS_URL)
//     with open(THREE_JS_LOCAL, "wb") as f:
//         f.write(r.content)
