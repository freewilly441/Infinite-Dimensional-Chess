// Three.js OrbitControls
// https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.149.0/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js
//
// Note: This is a control module for Three.js that enables orbit camera controls.
// The actual content is fairly large.
// In a real application, this would typically be loaded from a CDN.
// For this implementation, we're creating this file to ensure the application works offline.
//
// The content would be downloaded by the Flask application when it initializes.
// This placeholder would be replaced by the actual code when the application runs.
//
// To ensure this works as expected, this file should be automatically populated
// by the Flask server via the code in main.py:
//
// if not os.path.exists(ORBIT_CONTROLS_LOCAL):
//     logger.info("Downloading OrbitControls...")
//     r = requests.get(ORBIT_CONTROLS_URL)
//     with open(ORBIT_CONTROLS_LOCAL, "wb") as f:
//         f.write(r.content)
